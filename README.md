Code release for Transferable Visual Pattern Memory Network for Domain Adaptation in Anomaly Detection.

If you have any problem about our code, feel free to contact fancangning@gmail.com or describe your problem in issues.

We reuse some basic code in MNAD (https://github.com/cvlab-yonsei/MNAD) and dalib (https://dalib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html). 

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the authors of MNAD and dalib for their contributions to the anomaly detection and domain adaptation community.

All the code about the part declared as novelty in this paper is done by ourselves.
